Snowpiercer is brilliant until it decides to explain itself to death. The best
films drop you into chaos and trust you to keep up. For thirty glorious minutes,
Snowpiercer is that film.

> Everybody get down! One... Two... Three... Four ...

Opening scene: Curtis stands, head tilted, counting. One door. Two doors. Three
doors. Four. The camera holds on his face. Is this reconnaissance? Planning? The
guards move on, but something has started.

Barrels roll out. Children climb inside. The tail-enders connect them with pipes
and poles. What the hell are they building? A battering ram? A trojan horse? The
film doesn't tell us; it shows us Curtis counting, shows us preparation, shows
us waiting.

The counting stops. The protein block slips from Curtis's hand. He's walking
now, crowd parting, music rising with each step. The guard barely has time to
turn before Curtis has the gun against his forehead. Metal on skin.

Click.

> THEY'VE GOT NO BULLETS!!!

The tail section explodes. Everyone grabs the connected barrels, surging forward
as one. One step. Two steps. Three steps. Four. It's not a trojan horse. They're
using the barrels to block the doors!

The music, the editing, the literal momentum of bodies pushing forward; it all
serves this one perfect moment. If Snowpiercer ended here, it'd be a perfect
short film.

Unfortunately, Snowpiercer is not a short film. The movie stops trusting its
audience. The beauty of that barrel reveal is we figure it out WITH them - no
one explains it, we just see it happen. But by the end, Wilford is literally
monologuing about sustainable ecosystems and predetermined revolution cycles.
Every mystery gets the worst possible resolution:

- Who's Wilford? Ed Harris doing his blandest Architect impression
- What's at the front? A disappointing engine room that looks like any
  industrial space
- Why the protein blocks? Bugs. Sure. Was anyone's mind blown by bugs?
- The whole rebellion? Actually orchestrated! (killing all dramatic weight)

It's like watching someone meticulously build this intricate puzzle box, then
instead of letting you open it, they take a hammer to it and explain what was
inside. The shift from "show" to "tell, repeatedly, with metaphors about
balance" is painful.

7/10
